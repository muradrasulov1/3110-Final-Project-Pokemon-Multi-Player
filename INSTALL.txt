Step-by-step guide on how to BUILD and INSTALL our Pokemon program

1) Through the Terminal (either on your Mac or bash in Windows), clone the following repo to your local machine to some new folder of your choice.
   With created folder, access it through Terminal and use 'git clone LINK-NAME' where LINK-NAME is the URL below.
https://github.com/muradrasulov1/3110-Final-Project-Pokemon-Multi-Player 

2) Once you are in your new cloned project repo in terminal, while in the root directory, cd in 3110-Final-Project-Pokemon-Multi-Player with
'cd 3110-Final-Project-Pokemon-Multi-Player/'
and, once there, do
'dune build'

3) Before proceeding, run the following in your terminal to make sure you have the yojson package installed on your machine.
'opam install yojson' 

4) Enter the lib directory of the project by using
'cd lib'

5) 'ocamlbuild -pkg yojson pokemon.native'

6) 'ocamlbuild -pkg yojson experimenting.native'

7) './experimenting.native'

8) Congrats! You are now in the game!

<<<DISCLAIMER>>>
If you want to try the runnable commands, such as 'make test' or 'make doc' and 'make opendoc', MAKE SURE TO CD OUT OF LIB Folder, because at the time of the game you are in the /lib
