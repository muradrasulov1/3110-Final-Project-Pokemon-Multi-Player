running "cloc --by-file --include-lang=OCaml .", initially 2312 lines of code is counted

however, in our "lib" file, we have a _build folder that is created upon running the game, which adds unnecessary lines of code.

When this _build is deleted (as it is not necessary for compilation), the total lines of code are 1878, still meeting the minimum.

Based on what our PG said, we implemented a .json file to utilize data in our code without adding to the LOC.

Considering our Pokemon type implementation however, we couldn't convert all of our data to json within our timeframe.
